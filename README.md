My repo for the semester is now complete! This repo contains all of my work this semetser. It contains my rough draft from earlier in the semester and my final paper folder, which contains my final paper LaTeX script, my bilbiography as a .bib document, the data I used (as an Excel file), and pdfs of the plots I generated in R which I imported into LaTeX.
